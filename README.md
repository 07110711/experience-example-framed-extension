# <div style="text-align: center">Framed Extension</div>
Includes a card implementation which renders a URL in an iframe and a page implementtation which renders a possibly different URL in an iframe.
<br/>

## Framed Card
The card's iframe source URL is configured by the Admin in Card Management. See [extension.js](./extension.js) configuration key cardIframeSource. The iframe will also attach sandbox options as configured in Card Management. Its key in extension.js is cardIframeSandboxOptions. For the list of sandbox options and their descriptions, see (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe#attr-sandbox). Example value _allow-same-origin allow-scripts_. allow-same-origin is needed if the framed content makes any JavaScript API calls. If you trust the framed URL, a list of sandbox options that you might use are: _allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-scripts allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox_.

As defined, you can not interact with the card. It is merely a link to the page. You can change this by altering the pageRoute entry in extension.js. If you do this, then you need to add something to the card to launch the page.

## Framed Page
The page's iframe source URL is configured by the Admin in Card Management. See [extension.js](./extension.js) configuration key pageIframeSource. The iframe will also attach sandbox options as configured in Card Management. Its key in extension.js is pageIframeSandboxOptions. For the list of sandbox options and their descriptions, see (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe#attr-sandbox).

## Template Card
The extension.js as delivered in this example uses the "Template Card" feature. This allows this card to be added in Card Management as a new card instance multiple times, with each instance configured to use different content. See the _template_ block contained in the card block of extension.js

## Multiple Cards instead of Template
There is an extension-multi-card.js file which shows an alternate way to define one or more non-template cards. This could be used as an example of creating single purpose cards in which the framed URLs are baked into the card rather than being configured in Card Management.
